                     =====================================
                      Building IQmol From Source on Linux
                     =====================================

These steps were used to compile under Ubuntu 16.04 (LTS):

apt-get install git
apt-get install gfortran
apt-get install cmake
apt-get install qt5-default
apt-get install libssh2-1-dev
apt-get install libssl-dev
apt-get install libboost-serialization-dev
apt-get install libboost-iostreams-dev
apt-get install libopenbabel-dev

git clone https://github.com/nutjunkie/IQmol.git

cd IQmol/src
qmake IQmol.pro
make


To include cml support in openbabel:

 #> apt-get install libxml2
 #> mkdir build
 #> cmake -DBUILD_SHARED=OFF ../
 #> make

1) Insure the necessary utilities and libraries are installed:

     apt-get install g++
     apt-get install git
     apt-get install cmake
     apt-get install gfortran
     apt-get install libssl-dev
     apt-get install openssl
     apt-get install libboost-dev
     apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev


2) Download the Qt libraries from www.qt.io

   Note that Qt5 libraries are required and most distributions only have Qt4
   packages so you cannot use apt-get.  The download (~600Mb) seems to be very
   slow and it is recommended that an appropriate mirror is used.  Be sure to 
   add the Qt bin directory to your path, using bash this can be accomplished
   by adding something similar to the following to ~/.bashrc:

      if [ -d "$DEV/Qt5.5.0/5.5/gcc_64/bin" ] ; then
         PATH="$DEV/Qt5.5.0/5.5/gcc_64/bin:$PATH"
      fi

   Note that $DEV should be set to the directory containing the Qt installation


3) Download the OpenBabel source from www.openbabel.org

   The latest version of the source is 2.3.2.  As with OpenMesh, I needed to
   specify the compier as g++-4.4.  Compile using cmake, libraries appear in 
   the lib directory.

       mkdir build && cd build
       cmake ../
       sudo make install

   I copied the babelconfig.h file from build/include to include/openbabel.


4) Download the LibSSH2 source from www.libssh2.org

   The latest version tested is 1.6.  Compilation is straightforward and
   results in shared and static libraries located in src/.libs

       ./configure --with-openssl --with-libz
       sudo make install


5) Compile the SymMol object file in src/Main
   There is one Fortran source file that must be compiled using gfortran.  I haven't 
   worked out how to get Qt to do this in the .pro file:

       gfortran -c symmol.f90


6) Compile IQmol  
   You may need to edit the IQmol/src/linux.pri file to reflect the locations
   of the various installed packages.  I put all the compiled libraries above
   in the $DEV directory which I specify in .bashrc

       qmake IQmol.pro
       make

7) The share data is expected to be in /usr/share/iqmol:

      sudo mkdir /usr/share/iqmol 
      sudo cp -R IQmol/src/share/* /usr/share/iqmol

   In particular, if the iqmol_povray.inc file is not found then IQmol may
   crash on startup.
