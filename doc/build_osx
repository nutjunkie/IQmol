                     ====================================
					  Building IQmol From Source on OS X
                     ====================================

Libraries
~~~~~~~~~

Most of the work required in compiling IQmol is setting up the required
libraries.  The compilation of the code itself is relatively straightforward.

 o You will need XCode > 5.0 installed in order to install the Qt libraries.
   To get the command line tools installed you need to run:
     xcode-select --install 

 o Download the Qt libraries from http://www.qt.io
   The latest version tested is 5.8.  Ensure that the bin directory
   containing qmake is added to your PATH, the default location for this is
   /Applications/Qt5.8/5.8/clang_64/bin

 o Ensure gfortran is installed, installer packages can be found at
   https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS

 o Cmake will be required to compile some of the libraries, the installer can
   be obtained from http://www.cmake.org/download/


 o OpenSSL:
   - Download: https://www.openssl.org/source  (version 1.0.1p tested)
   - Compile:  The regular compilation does not compile x86 code, so we envoke
     Configure manually:

        ./Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc
        make

   - Static libraries (libssl.a & libcrypto.a) appear in top directory and may need to be moved to the lib
     subdirectory (which may need to be created) for the libssh2 compilation.


 o LibSSH2:
   - Download: http://www.libssh2.org  (version 1.9.0 tested)
   - Compile (making sure the correct path for libssl is specified): 

        ./configure --with-crypto=openssl --with-libssl-prefix=/path/to/openssl-1.0.1q --with-libz
        make

   - Shared and static libraries located in src/.libs

   - with cmake:
cmake -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=$DEV/openssl-1.1.1f/ -DOPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=$DEV/openssl-1.1.1f/include/ -DOPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARY=$DEV/openssl-1.1.1f/libcrypto.a -DOPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARY=$DEV/Development/openssl-1.1.1f/libssl.a ../


 o Boost:
   - Download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.76.0/

        ./bootstrap.sh --prefix= -with-toolset=clang
        ./b2 

   - Static libraries are in stage/lib.


 o OpenBabel:
   - Download: https://sourceforge.net/projects/openbabel/files/openbabel/ (2.4.1)
   - Source can be downloaded and compiled with (in the build directory):

        cmake -DBUILD_SHARED=OFF -DWITH_STATIC_INCHI=ON -DWITH_STATIC_LIBXML=ON -DLIBXML2_LIBRARIES=/path/to/libxml2/2.9.12/lib/ -DLIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/libxml2/2.9.12/include -DZLIB_LIBRARY=/path/to/zlib/1.2.11/lib/ -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/zlib/1.2.11/include/ ..
        make

	 The static libopenbabel.a will be in the build/src directory. This 
     library archive contains all plugins.



Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~

 o Compile the SymMol object file in src/Main and copy symmol.o to ../../build
      gfortran -c symmol.f90

 o Edit the common.pri file to reflect the locations of the various libraries
   required.  I keep all these in a common directory set in the $DEV environment
   variable.

 o Compile the remaining IQmol source. The application will be built in
   IQmol.app/Contents/MacOS/
      qmake IQmol.pro
      make

 o If the previous step is successful, copy share/ to IQmol.app/Contents. This
   enables the use of shaders, molecule fragments, and the QUI interface.
