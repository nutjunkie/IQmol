   <p> The Model View window provides a hierarchical view of the data
   strucutures that appear in the Viewer window.  Each molecule is represented
   as a node or layer in the Model View, and each layer can have child layers
   that can represent atoms, bonds and other associated data.

   <p> Visibility of layers is controlled by the associated checkbox.
   Unchecking a checkbox causes the item and all its children to become hidden.
   If an item does not have a checkbox, for example a bond, then its visibility
   can only be controlled by layers higher in the hierarchy.

   <p> Many layers have configuration options that can be accessed by double
   clicking the layer in the Model View.  For example, double clicking a
   molecule layer brings up the following configuration dialog:

   <p> Each layer can be configured separately.  For more information about the
   different types of layers in IQmol see the <a href="layers.html">Layers</a> page.
